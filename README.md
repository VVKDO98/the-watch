# The Watch

In this repo you'll find all the technology watch I did at BeCode. 

A tech talk is an oral presentation on a technology or IT topic to a specialist audience. Organised by companies, universities or other groups, they aim to share knowledge and ideas on technology topics, either in person or online.
